# ðŸ““ My Neural Signal Processing Notes

This repository serves as a personal resource for EEG data analysis. It is designed to help me quickly revisit and apply various concepts related to neural signal processing whenever needed. 

If I need to perform or review specific techniques, I can refer to the **how_to** section for practical guidance and explanations.

## ðŸ“š Resources
All of the codes in this repository are inspired by the content provided by **Mike X. Cohen**. For a deeper understanding of neural signal processing, I recommend exploring the following resources:

- **Book:** Cohen, M. X. (2014). *Analyzing Neural Time Series Data: Theory and Practice*. The MIT Press.
- **Online Course:** [Udemy - Complete Neural Signal Processing and Analysis: Zero to Hero by Mike X Cohen](https://www.udemy.com/).
